# 10ps_simulation
A 10ps of equilibration with varying constarints and production is done to verify the code and to verify the input and output files to use it later in cluster.

STEP1: 
Protein alignment with membrane using opm server: different methods are tried to align teh protein properly to the membrane.
STEP2:energy minimisation
STEP3: equilibration with constarints on protein
STEP4: equilibration with constraints on heavy atoms
STEP5:equilibration with constraints on c-alpha atoms
STEP6: production
