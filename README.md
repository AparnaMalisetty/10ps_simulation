# 10ps_simulation
A 10ps of equilibration with varying constarints and production is done to verify the code and to verify the input and output files to use it later in cluster.

STEPS: 
1) Protein alignment with membrane using opm server: different methods are tried to align the protein properly to the membrane.
2) embedding the protein in membrane using g_membed
3) energy minimisation
4) equilibration with constarints on protein
5) equilibration with constraints on heavy atoms
6) equilibration with constraints on c-alpha atoms
7) production
