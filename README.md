# 10ps_simulation
A 10ps of equilibration with varying constarints and production is done to verify the code and to verify the input and output files to use it later in cluster.


steps:
1) protein alignment with membrane using opm server: different methods are tried to align teh protein properly to the membrane.
A) method1:
B) method2:
C) method3:
D) method4:
3) energy minimisation
4) equilibvration with constarints on protein
5) equilibration with constraints on heavy atoms
6) equilibration with constraints on c-alpha atoms
7) production
